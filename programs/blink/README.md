### Installation

I've been using [Platformio](https://platformio.org) & [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to program the atmega328p but you can also use the Arduino IDE if you prefer.

### Uploading

Uploading was done with a cheap stlink device. 
The upload command for flashing the blackpill is:

```sh
$ platformio run -t upload
```
